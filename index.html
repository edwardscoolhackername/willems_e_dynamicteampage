        <p>Edward Willems is a perpetual student and sometimes an artist. He studied Studio Art at the University of Guelph for five years before beginning his journey of coding at Fanshawe. He no longer has time for hobbies, but tries to make time for reading fantasy novels and painting miniatures. He is determined to make fun user-friendly websites and programs, making interaction intuitive and interesting.</p>

          <p>Micah Berbleschpe is a feral and vicious coder. He first got into Python thinking it would involve fighting oversized snakes, and instead took to the coding language faster than English. His fevered grunts and growls from over his keyboard have made him a frighteningly productive member of the team. He was last seen with a lot of copper wiring under his arm, but his current whereabouts are unknown. </p>
